questions:
how many moves per turn ??

allow interaction between paths of pieces, few examples: path extension with friendly pieces, fading of path lenght in extension 
stoping of path after extension


addition features:

diag movement with hoover and combined orthogonal movement

have two sides, take pieces by moving AI

do something with the movement patterns

backstory +gameplay:

on the deepest real time level you are free to paint with your path however you want
you don't get as much score as on the structured turn based one

on the highest level there should be an AI sometimes being the "magic hand" moving other pieces
this magic hand can be indirectly informed by the movements the player on the lower level makes

the bigger covered tiles are implicitly more expensive

all the cover tiles are reflected into the lowest real time level tile
you cannot directly interact with the drawn structure or with the movement of your own pawns,
but still with mindfull movement there is influence


code improv:

use rx for ui
be able to observe the end of the start method of a gameobject
add reactive property starting with tilegraphic reachable
add implicit cast between tile tilegraphic piece piecegraphic, it's a 1 1 relation

TODO

colour tiles based on move, keep score
test player capturing

real time tile entering move in it
