questions:

capture pieces 

idea, get points for tiles colored (as some kind of mana) can be used to do more moves in time
and pieces cannot move over tiles colored by other player (the first holds)
the player/piece is the only hole in the wall
increase range with mana

how many moves per turn ??

allow interaction between paths of pieces, few examples: path extension with friendly pieces, fading of path lenght in extension 
stoping of path after extension


addition features:

Sacrifice:

-----
real time implement, when you go into the deepest level you have an out of piece experience, you become a ghost and can release 
previously captured pieces, the price you have to pay is that all your pieces are turned in the opposite color
also you piece stays behind on the board, thus if it's catched you lose

extra points for killing tile with player in

make clock turn logarithmic scale

diag movement with hoover and combined orthogonal movement

have two sides, take pieces by moving AI

do something with the movement patterns

make a list of players instead of only two

real time tile entering gameplay

the camera movement should be restricted when you are able to trap the player, 
the more pieces trapped the more camera movement is restricted to the bounding box of the path

backstory +gameplay:

on the deepest real time level you are free to paint with your path however you want
you don't get as much score as on the structured turn based one

on the highest level there should be an AI sometimes being the "magic hand" moving other pieces
this magic hand can be indirectly informed by the movements the player on the lower level makes

the bigger covered tiles are implicitly more expensive

all the cover tiles are reflected into the lowest real time level tile
you cannot directly interact with the drawn structure or with the movement of your own pawns,
but still with mindfull movement there is influence


code improv:

use rx for ui
be able to observe the end of the start method of a gameobject
add reactive property starting with tilegraphic reachable
add implicit cast between tile tilegraphic piece piecegraphic, it's a 1 1 relation

TODO


board to string or to int[][]
tile to string

sync board init
add text to inform player of network status
add player when join button is pressed
once the player is set, also add it to 
send moves over network

change piece does not end your turn

show score of #pieces

playtest

make AI smarter, if player/pieces is within range take him
