questions:

capture pieces 

idea, get points for tiles colored (as some kind of mana) can be used to do more moves in time
and pieces cannot move over tiles colored by other player (the first holds)
the player/piece is the only hole in the wall
increase range with mana

how many moves per turn ??

allow interaction between paths of pieces, few examples: path extension with friendly pieces, fading of path lenght in extension 
stoping of path after extension


addition features:

when doind a move you can send both the piece and the tile, but one of both could also be derived at the slave client side
this could be a consistency check

check if it is necessary to build the board after everyone is connected, according to photon the server send last message to joiners

Sacrifice:

-----
real time implement, when you go into the deepest level you have an out of piece experience, you become a ghost and can release 
previously captured pieces, the price you have to pay is that all your pieces are turned in the opposite color
also you piece stays behind on the board, thus if it's catched you lose

extra points for killing tile with player in

make clock turn logarithmic scale

diag movement with hoover and combined orthogonal movement

have two sides, take pieces by moving AI

do something with the movement patterns


real time tile entering gameplay

the camera movement should be restricted when you are able to trap the player, 
the more pieces trapped the more camera movement is restricted to the bounding box of the path

backstory +gameplay:

on the deepest real time level you are free to paint with your path however you want
you don't get as much score as on the structured turn based one

on the highest level there should be an AI sometimes being the "magic hand" moving other pieces
this magic hand can be indirectly informed by the movements the player on the lower level makes

the bigger covered tiles are implicitly more expensive

all the cover tiles are reflected into the lowest real time level tile
you cannot directly interact with the drawn structure or with the movement of your own pawns,
but still with mindfull movement there is influence


code improv:


add reactive properties everywhere with changing variables
add implicit cast between tile tilegraphic piece piecegraphic, it's a 1 1 relation

make time left with rx

TODO


text message wait for connection
mouse wheel + click and drag movement

catching a black piece takes a turn

button for reconnect network (leave/join room)



allow player to choose it's color-> r g b input 


make some kind of config flow for multiplayer session, wait for connect, built if master, than join button appears (with color of already existing players)
add text to inform player of network status


fix observable bug in remaining time
remaining time is the absolutate time modulo your turn



playtest

make AI smarter, if player/pieces is within range take him


idea for real time once in lowest layer, piece/player roams randomly but the user can crawl around the board and capture another (or multiple pieces) 
by mergin with them
